# Assignment 01 (Linked List basic Operations):

## Assignment Objectives
The main objective of this assignment is to implement and test various operations on linked lists. You will create a Java class to handle linked list operations, including inserting at the start, deleting from the start, displaying the list, inserting at the end, deleting from the end, and finding the size of the linked list.

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. InsertAtStart
**Objective**: Implement a method to insert a new node at the beginning of the linked list.
- **Method Name**: `InsertAtStart`
- **Functionality**: Adds a node with a specified value at the start of the list.
- **Example**: Inserting values `5`, `10`, and `15` should result in the list `15 -> 10 -> 5`.

### 2. DeleteAtStart
**Objective**: Implement a method to delete the node at the beginning of the linked list.
- **Method Name**: `DeleteAtStart`
- **Functionality**: Removes the first node of the list.
- **Example**: After inserting `5`, `10`, and `15`, and calling `DeleteAtStart`, the list should be `10 -> 5`.

### 3. Display
**Objective**: Implement a method to display all the nodes in the linked list.
- **Method Name**: `Display`
- **Functionality**: Prints all nodes in the list.
- **Example**: For the list `15 -> 10 -> 5`, the output should be `15 10 5`.

### 4. DeleteAtEnd
**Objective**: Implement a method to delete the node at the end of the linked list.
- **Method Name**: `DeleteAtEnd`
- **Functionality**: Removes the last node of the list.
- **Example**: After inserting `5`, `10`, `15`, and `20`, and calling `DeleteAtEnd`, the list should be `5 -> 10 -> 15`.

### 5. InsertAtEnd
**Objective**: Implement a method to insert a new node at the end of the linked list.
- **Method Name**: `InsertAtEnd`
- **Functionality**: Adds a node with a specified value at the end of the list.
- **Example**: After inserting `5`, `10`, and `15`, and adding `20` at the end, the list should be `5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20`.

### 6. Size
**Objective**: Implement a method to find the size of the linked list.
- **Method Name**: `Size`
- **Functionality**: Returns the number of nodes in the list.
- **Example**: For the list `5 -> 10 -> 15`, the size should be `3`.

## Code Implementation
Provide a Java class that includes the above methods. Ensure that the code handles all operations correctly and that the list is updated as expected.
