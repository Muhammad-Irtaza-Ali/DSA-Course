# Lab 01: Fundamentals of Array Data Structure

## Lab Objectives
The primary goal of this lab is to develop skills in array data structures, string operations, and algorithmic problem-solving. The lab focuses on key operations such as searching, inserting, deleting, comparing, and understanding complex string manipulations.

## Lab Overview

### Lab Task 01: Array Basics and Traversal
**Objective**: Learn how to declare, initialize, and traverse an array.
- **Exercise 1**: Declare an integer array of size 6 and initialize it with the values `{5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55}`. Write a program to print all elements of the array.
  - **Expected Output**: `5 15 25 35 45 55`
- **Exercise 2**: Modify the program to print each element with its corresponding index.
  - **Expected Output**: 
    ```
    Element at index 0: 5
    Element at index 1: 15
    Element at index 2: 25
    Element at index 3: 35
    Element at index 4: 45
    Element at index 5: 55
    ```

### Lab Task 02: Insertion in Arrays
**Objective**: Practice inserting elements at different positions in an array.
- **Exercise 1**: Insert an element at the start of the array. Start with the array `{12, 24, 36, 48, 60}`. Insert the value `6` at the beginning.
  - **Expected Output**: `6 12 24 36 48 60`
- **Exercise 2**: Insert an element in the middle of the array. Start with the array `{100, 200, 300, 400, 500}`. Insert the value `250` at the 2nd index.
  - **Expected Output**: `100 200 250 300 400 500`
- **Exercise 3**: Insert an element at the end of the array. Start with the array `{3, 6, 9, 12, 15}`. Insert the value `18` at the end.
  - **Expected Output**: `3 6 9 12 15 18`

### Lab Task 03: Deletion in Arrays
**Objective**: Learn how to delete elements from an array.
- **Exercise 1**: Delete an element from a specific position. Start with the array `{8, 16, 24, 32, 40}`. Delete the element at index 2.
  - **Expected Output**: `8 16 32 40 0`

### Lab Task 04: Searching in Arrays
**Objective**: Practice different search techniques in arrays.
- **Exercise 1**: Search for an element by its index. Start with the array `{13, 26, 39, 52, 65}`. Search for the element at index 4.
  - **Expected Output**: `Element at index 4: 65`
- **Exercise 2**: Implement linear search to find an element by its value. Start with the array `{4, 6, 2, 8, 10}`. Search for the value `8`.
  - **Expected Output**: `Element 8 found at index 3`
- **Exercise 3**: Implement binary search on a sorted array. Start with the sorted array `{11, 22, 33, 44, 55}`. Search for the value `33`.
  - **Expected Output**: `Element 33 found at index 2`

### Lab Task 05: Reverse Array
**Objective**: Write a function `reverseArray` that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array that is the reverse of the input array.
- **Input**: `1 3 5 7 9`
- **Expected Output**: `9 7 5 3 1`

### Lab Task 06: Palindrome Check
**Objective**: Determine if a given string is a palindrome.
- **Input String**: `radar`
  - **Expected Output**: `Palindrome`
- **Input String**: `apple`
  - **Expected Output**: `Not Palindrome`

### Lab Task 07: Anagram Check
**Objective**: Given two strings, determine if they are anagrams of each other.
- **Input Strings**:
  - `str1 = "listen"`
  - `str2 = "silent"`
  - **Expected Output**: `Anagram`
- **Input Strings**:
  - `str1 = "hello"`
  - `str2 = "world"`
  - **Expected Output**: `Not Anagram`
